The subwoofer adds a nice bass to the music and movies. The installation was easy and the remote control has different modes to adjust the sound.However, I also noticed some issues with this product. The soundbar gets very hot after a few minutes of use and I’m worried it might damage the device. The bluetooth range is not very good and sometimes the connection drops. The remote control only works if you point it directly at the soundbar, which is inconvenient.

       " '\\nI bought this soundbar to enhance my TV audio and I was impressed by the sound quality and the Dolby effect. The sound is clear, loud and immersive. The subwoofer adds a nice bass to the music and movies. The installation was easy and the remote control has different modes to adjust the sound.However, I also noticed some issues with this product. The soundbar gets very hot after a few minutes of use and I’m worried it might damage the device. The bluetooth range is not very good and sometimes the connection drops. The remote control only works if you point it directly at the soundbar, which is inconvenient. I wish they had improved these aspects of the product.Overall, I think this soundbar is good for its price but it has some flaws that need to be fixed.\\n',\n",

The soundbar gets very hot after a few minutes of use and I’m worried it might damage the device. The bluetooth range is not very good and sometimes the connection drops.

       " '\\nI bought this soundbar to enhance my TV audio and I was impressed by the sound quality and the Dolby effect. The sound is clear, loud and immersive. The subwoofer adds a nice bass to the music and movies. The installation was easy and the remote control has different modes to adjust the sound.However, I also noticed some issues with this product. The soundbar gets very hot after a few minutes of use and I’m worried it might damage the device. The bluetooth range is not very good and sometimes the connection drops. The remote control only works if you point it directly at the soundbar, which is inconvenient. I wish they had improved these aspects of the product.Overall, I think this soundbar is good for its price but it has some flaws that need to be fixed.\\n',\n",

warranty quality good build quality sound overall good price remote bluetooth bass look function that s better product design is good sound quality is very good when connected with mobile or laptop satisfied with the product that s d sound quality and bass good looks and sound but battery discharges very quickly and remote too is not working always good so basse sound is low good i bought this soundbar to enhance my tv audio and i was impressed by the sound quality and the dolby effect the sound is clear loud and immersive the subwoofer adds a nice bass to the music and movies the installation was easy and the remote control has different modes to adjust the sound however i also noticed some issues with this product the soundbar gets very hot after a few minutes of use and i m worried it might damage the device the bluetooth range is not very good and sometimes the connection drops the remote control only works if you point it directly at the soundbar which is inconvenient i wish they had improved these aspects of the product overall i think this soundbar is good for its price but it has some flaws that need to be fixed awesome product is sleek and with decent sound out put i had a boat stone speaker before it had better output than this one even though stone was w rms connectivity is good sound clarity would have been better but i would recommend this product for

       "'i bought this soundbar to enhance my tv audio and i was impressed by the sound quality and the dolby effect. the sound is clear loud and immersive. the subwoofer adds a nice bass to the music and movies. the installation was easy and the remote control has different modes to adjust the sound.however i also noticed some issues with this product. the soundbar gets very hot after a few minutes of use and i m worried it might damage the device. the bluetooth range is not very good and sometimes the connection drops. the remote control only works if you point it directly at the soundbar which is inconvenient. i wish they had improved these aspects of the product.overall i think this soundbar is good for its price but it has some flaws that need to be fixed. awesome product is sleek and with decent sound out put .i had a boat stone speaker before it had better output than this one even though stone was w rms .connectivity is good sound clarity would have been better but i would recommend this product for the price. sound quality is not good in normal eq but in bass mode sound quality is good. price little bit heavy coz of remote but overall a satisfying product. only

sound but battery discharges very quickly and remote too is not working always. good so basse sound is low good i bought this soundbar to enhance my tv audio and i was impressed by the sound quality and the dolby effect. the sound is clear loud and immersive. the subwoofer adds a nice bass to the music and movies. the installation was easy and the remote control has different modes to adjust the sound.however i also noticed some issues with this product. the soundbar gets very hot after a few minutes of use and i m worried it might damage the device. the bluetooth range is not very good and sometimes the connection drops. the remote control only works if you point it directly at the soundbar which is inconvenient. i wish they had improved these aspects of the product.overall i think this soundbar is good for its price but it has some flaws that need to be fixed. awesome product is sleek and with decent sound out put .i had a boat stone speaker before it had better output than this one even though stone was w rms .connectivity is good sound clarity would have been better but i would recommend this product for the price. sound quality is not good in normal eq but in bass mode sound quality is good. price little bit heavy coz of remote but overall a satisfying product. only one thing is missing button indication light. if you are looking a boom badd sound blaster soundbar then it s not for you but if you are looking a creamy smooth clear sound with good look handy soundbar then go for it .one year warranty.quality good build quality .sound overall good .price remote bluetooth bass look .function . that s better product design is good. sound quality is very good when connected with mobile or laptop.satisfied with the product. that s d sound quality and bass good looks and
